We have tons of items that we don't need but it is bothersome to research how to get rid of them. Many times throwing them away is not a good option. The earth is not a trash bin.

This app lets you select the object you don't need and it will give you a fleet of possible approaches. That sweater you won't wear anymore? Christmas is coming, there are donaion and charity events! Local shops are accepting old clothes and giving away discount coupons. There is a new thrift shop nearby! Choose for yourself, we provide the suggestions.

The app uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to:
 * collect data from the web, categorize it and save it into our database. 
 * parse your item input and find suggestions for it
